        <title>Highlighting the Internet (part 2)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago I built the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/01/highlighting-the-internet/&quot;&gt;first part&lt;/a&gt; of a project to help me more actively read, recall what I read, and keep track of all the delightful bits of prose I come upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I finished up the project by 1) figuring out how to save highlighted text from any possible web page, and 2) building a way to nicely display all those interesting bits of text on a &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/reading/&quot;&gt;web page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I created a GitHub organization to house all the code (really not a lot of code) for this.  Check it out and set it up for yourself: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reading-highlights&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;icon icon--github&quot;&gt;&lt;svg viewbox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill=&quot;#828282&quot; d=&quot;M7.999,0.431c-4.285,0-7.76,3.474-7.76,7.761 c0,3.428,2.223,6.337,5.307,7.363c0.388,0.071,0.53-0.168,0.53-0.374c0-0.184-0.007-0.672-0.01-1.32 c-2.159,0.469-2.614-1.04-2.614-1.04c-0.353-0.896-0.862-1.135-0.862-1.135c-0.705-0.481,0.053-0.472,0.053-0.472 c0.779,0.055,1.189,0.8,1.189,0.8c0.692,1.186,1.816,0.843,2.258,0.645c0.071-0.502,0.271-0.843,0.493-1.037 C4.86,11.425,3.049,10.76,3.049,7.786c0-0.847,0.302-1.54,0.799-2.082C3.768,5.507,3.501,4.718,3.924,3.65 c0,0,0.652-0.209,2.134,0.796C6.677,4.273,7.34,4.187,8,4.184c0.659,0.003,1.323,0.089,1.943,0.261 c1.482-1.004,2.132-0.796,2.132-0.796c0.423,1.068,0.157,1.857,0.077,2.054c0.497,0.542,0.798,1.235,0.798,2.082 c0,2.981-1.814,3.637-3.543,3.829c0.279,0.24,0.527,0.713,0.527,1.437c0,1.037-0.01,1.874-0.01,2.129 c0,0.208,0.14,0.449,0.534,0.373c3.081-1.028,5.302-3.935,5.302-7.362C15.76,3.906,12.285,0.431,7.999,0.431z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;design-summary&quot;&gt;Design Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/highlights-architecture-v2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Reading Highlights Architecture v2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a diagram of the design.  It uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/sns/&quot;&gt;AWS SNS&lt;/a&gt; as a simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish–subscribe_pattern&quot;&gt;pub/sub&lt;/a&gt; service, Google Spreadsheets as a database, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/&quot;&gt;AWS Lambda&lt;/a&gt; functions to collect the highlights from various sources and then write them to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VCkPCinhG-HiZJuvWPYq1wMIEpdHOdbCRF2lTDsOMBc/&quot;&gt;spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;.  Then I use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jsoma&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;icon icon--github&quot;&gt;&lt;svg viewbox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill=&quot;#828282&quot; d=&quot;M7.999,0.431c-4.285,0-7.76,3.474-7.76,7.761 c0,3.428,2.223,6.337,5.307,7.363c0.388,0.071,0.53-0.168,0.53-0.374c0-0.184-0.007-0.672-0.01-1.32 c-2.159,0.469-2.614-1.04-2.614-1.04c-0.353-0.896-0.862-1.135-0.862-1.135c-0.705-0.481,0.053-0.472,0.053-0.472 c0.779,0.055,1.189,0.8,1.189,0.8c0.692,1.186,1.816,0.843,2.258,0.645c0.071-0.502,0.271-0.843,0.493-1.037 C4.86,11.425,3.049,10.76,3.049,7.786c0-0.847,0.302-1.54,0.799-2.082C3.768,5.507,3.501,4.718,3.924,3.65 c0,0,0.652-0.209,2.134,0.796C6.677,4.273,7.34,4.187,8,4.184c0.659,0.003,1.323,0.089,1.943,0.261 c1.482-1.004,2.132-0.796,2.132-0.796c0.423,1.068,0.157,1.857,0.077,2.054c0.497,0.542,0.798,1.235,0.798,2.082 c0,2.981-1.814,3.637-3.543,3.829c0.279,0.24,0.527,0.713,0.527,1.437c0,1.037-0.01,1.874-0.01,2.129 c0,0.208,0.14,0.449,0.534,0.373c3.081-1.028,5.302-3.935,5.302-7.362C15.76,3.906,12.285,0.431,7.999,0.431z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;username&quot;&gt;jsoma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 /
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop&quot;&gt;tabletop&lt;/a&gt; library to pull from the spreadsheet and create a &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/reading/&quot;&gt;nice looking web page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;details-highlight-any-page&quot;&gt;Details: Highlight Any Page&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after figuring out how to collect my &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com&quot;&gt;medium.com&lt;/a&gt; highlights, I needed to do the same for text I highlighted elsewhere on the web – on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com&quot;&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://qz.com&quot;&gt;qz.com,&lt;/a&gt; or any other site I read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were really two problems to solve here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. How do I highlight text while I’m reading it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Browsers do not provide a native way to highlight text – like yellow-highlighter-highlight it – although there seems to be an effort to define a standard by the W3C &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/annotation/&quot;&gt;Web Annotation Working Group&lt;/a&gt;.  This is great, but unfortunately doesn’t help me much right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after much searching, I found an open source project called &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is&quot;&gt;hypothes.is&lt;/a&gt;.  They have created a Chrome extension and a browser-agnostic bookmarklet allowing you to highlight (and annotate!) text on any web page.  It is based on an open source JavaScript library, &lt;a href=&quot;http://annotatorjs.org&quot;&gt;Annotator&lt;/a&gt;, which allows annotation functionality to be added to any web page.  I also really like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is/about/&quot;&gt;overall goals&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is&quot;&gt;hypothes.is&lt;/a&gt; including their non-profit status and that they are a contributor to the W3C Web Annotation Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hypothesis-bookmarklet-highlight.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Highlighting with Hypothes.is Bookmarklet in Safari&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of the browser bookmarklet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hypothesis-chrome-highlight.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Highlighting with Hypothes.is Chrome Extension&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s an example of the Chrome extension in action.  They’re pretty similar.  The only downside for me is that neither work or work very well in iOS Safari or Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Now, how do I save the highlighted bits of text along with some metadata about the page?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is&quot;&gt;Hypothes.is&lt;/a&gt; also solves this problem.  In addition to highlighting the text in yellow, it saves the highlight plus metadata to &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is&quot;&gt;hypothes.is&lt;/a&gt; databases.  And &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is&quot;&gt;hypothes.is&lt;/a&gt; provides an &lt;a href=&quot;http://h.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; so that I can extract my highlights in a structured format and write them to a Google Spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;details-display-the-highlights&quot;&gt;Details: Display The Highlights&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the highlights were stored in a Google Spreadsheet, I wanted a way to display them in a stylized format on the web.  I found a library on GitHub called tabletop (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jsoma&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;icon icon--github&quot;&gt;&lt;svg viewbox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill=&quot;#828282&quot; d=&quot;M7.999,0.431c-4.285,0-7.76,3.474-7.76,7.761 c0,3.428,2.223,6.337,5.307,7.363c0.388,0.071,0.53-0.168,0.53-0.374c0-0.184-0.007-0.672-0.01-1.32 c-2.159,0.469-2.614-1.04-2.614-1.04c-0.353-0.896-0.862-1.135-0.862-1.135c-0.705-0.481,0.053-0.472,0.053-0.472 c0.779,0.055,1.189,0.8,1.189,0.8c0.692,1.186,1.816,0.843,2.258,0.645c0.071-0.502,0.271-0.843,0.493-1.037 C4.86,11.425,3.049,10.76,3.049,7.786c0-0.847,0.302-1.54,0.799-2.082C3.768,5.507,3.501,4.718,3.924,3.65 c0,0,0.652-0.209,2.134,0.796C6.677,4.273,7.34,4.187,8,4.184c0.659,0.003,1.323,0.089,1.943,0.261 c1.482-1.004,2.132-0.796,2.132-0.796c0.423,1.068,0.157,1.857,0.077,2.054c0.497,0.542,0.798,1.235,0.798,2.082 c0,2.981-1.814,3.637-3.543,3.829c0.279,0.24,0.527,0.713,0.527,1.437c0,1.037-0.01,1.874-0.01,2.129 c0,0.208,0.14,0.449,0.534,0.373c3.081-1.028,5.302-3.935,5.302-7.362C15.76,3.906,12.285,0.431,7.999,0.431z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;

 /
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop&quot;&gt;tabletop&lt;/a&gt;).  Tabletop made it really easy to grab data from the spreadsheet and slap it in to a little &lt;a href=&quot;http://handlebarsjs.com&quot;&gt;handlebars&lt;/a&gt; template!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/reading-highlights-page.png&quot; alt=&quot;Reading Highlights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cheap&quot;&gt;Cheap&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that all of the AWS pieces cost less than a dollar a month – actually, likely less than $0.25 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Highlighting the Internet</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I spend a large chunk of my day reading – learning about the world, the people in it, and the ways in which we interact.  So many people, events, and discoveries only 15 years ago were hidden (from me) because they weren’t easy to broadly, publicly share.  The internet and its &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.google.com&quot;&gt;news.google.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-eBooks&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and a multitude of other sites and applications have made the world’s information quickly and cheaply accessible to anyone with a connection to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recall&quot;&gt;Recall&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was finding more and more to read, I grew frustrated by not being able to recall the important parts.  Remember back in school you used to underline and highlight and annotate the crap out of stuff you read for class?  I wanted that experience back.  Highlighting not only helps me better remember what I’m reading, it helps me distill and remember the important parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;highlighting-browser-text&quot;&gt;Highlighting Browser Text&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do you highlight in a web browser on a laptop?  And what about on a phone?  Or a Kindle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/medium-highlight.png&quot; alt=&quot;Medium Highlight&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-story/is-it-ok-to-highlight-your-own-stuff-fd3768dace9a#.djpp8o5z3&quot;&gt;Medium began allowing readers to highlight and save bits of text from blog posts&lt;/a&gt;.  And the Kindle has always allowed readers to do this.  These two constitute a large part of my reading, but what about other websites?  Maybe a browser plugin?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;organizing-my-highlights&quot;&gt;Organizing My Highlights&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, now that I’ve got a solution to highlighting text on the internet, let’s talk about how to collect and organize those highlights.  Why might I want to do that?  It started from an urge to better journal and reflect on my days, but there are lots of other reasons: posterity, manual review/lookup, statistical analysis, or even to power a section of this site!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently working on a set of simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/&quot;&gt;AWS Lambda&lt;/a&gt; functions to automatically collect all my highlights and write them to a Google Spreadsheet.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VCkPCinhG-HiZJuvWPYq1wMIEpdHOdbCRF2lTDsOMBc&quot;&gt;Check out the spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;, fully populated from a set of AWS Lambda functions over the past few weeks.  The Google Spreadsheet acts as a database in this setup.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://jlord.us/sheetsee.js/docs/basics.html&quot;&gt;Google Spreadsheets work very well as databases for simple applications like this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/highlights-architecture.png&quot; alt=&quot;Reading Highlights Architecture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a simple diagram of how all the pieces fit together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/01/highlighting-the-internet-part-2/&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;, where I share more details about how I built this and what I’m using it for!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>International Travel</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the winter of 2014/15, I took off from the USA for four months to do some dirt biking in Africa, dog sledding in Sweden, and general exploring around the world!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/travel-mosaic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Travel Mosaic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t traveled much internationally prior to this.  I did a semester abroad in Ireland, but that didn’t really seem like long-term, solo, international travel – probably because the school program had everything so tightly organized for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, I organized everything myself stitching almost every activity on my bucket list into an epic 115 days of geographic, cultural, animal, and personal exploration.  I gotta say, the month-long planning process was almost as fun as the actual travel.  I started planning about a month of travel.  That grew to 1.5 months.  And then that ballooned to almost four months.  There was so much I wanted to do, and I knew I might not get an opportunity like this again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;are-you-going-to-drop-off-the-face-of-the-earth&quot;&gt;“Are you going to drop off the face of the earth?”&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad asked me this as I was planning out the itinerary.  He was worried he wouldn’t hear from me for months and wouldn’t know if I was having so much fun I just didn’t have time to call or dead in a gutter somewhere.  Fair point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/travel/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/travel.png&quot; alt=&quot;Travel Map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew that I wasn’t going to write.  I probably was going to forget to call.  But I knew for sure that I would be taking pictures.  So I setup a simple static web page with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mapbox.com&quot;&gt;Mapbox&lt;/a&gt; map on it and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/crcastle/crcastle.github.io/blob/master/travel/markers.csv&quot;&gt;pre-define some hashtags&lt;/a&gt; for each location to which I was planning to travel.  Any time I posted a picture to Instagram all I had to do was tag it with one of the pre-defined hashtags and it would automatically appear on &lt;a href=&quot;/travel/&quot;&gt;the map web page&lt;/a&gt; associated with a pin showing where I was.  This was great because I wasn’t going to have a computer with me while traveling.  I wouldn’t have been able to manage anything more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;free&quot;&gt;Free&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this was and is completely free to run.  The HTML/CSS/JS files are stored on GitHub and served by GitHub Pages.  The customized map was free with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/&quot;&gt;Mapbox Starter Plan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/crcastle/crcastle.github.io/tree/master/travel&quot;&gt;all the code&lt;/a&gt;, including the JavaScript that ties it all together, if you’re interested in digging in more.&lt;/p&gt;
