Customer Partner Program
1. Identify ideal traits of customer partner for this specific product
2. Generate list of potential customer partners (using internet, industry research, phone book, networking, linkedin).  Need at least 10 leads here because not everyone is going to want to be a partner. (identify a conversion rate here after a while)
3. Make initial contact w/ each potential customer parter explaining the product (and the overall business if it's interesting to them), what they'll get from the program, and what would be expected of them as a partner.  Initial contact could be email, phone, mail, or in-person visit.  Determine the right channel per-product.  Maybe one channel, maybe multiple.  Prep for this will require creating "customer partner collateral".  Nice looking one-pager explaining product, potential ways it can help the business, and ease of use/installation.
4. Then gauge level of interest in being a partner (should be excited to be an early adopter) and ability to provide feedback.
5. If mutual decision to move forward, second meeting (partner interview) to better understand and document their pain points.  Document and share this feedback with development team... or even better, have them directly involved with partner interview.
6. Provide regular, quick updates to partner with status of the product.  Initially we won't have detailed estimates for how long hardware and software development will take.
