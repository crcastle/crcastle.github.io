Notes from Hooper meeting:

"Quick Reference Deck"

- Review transitions between slides

- Two kinds of execution: product build and fit   +  sales and marketing execution
   - incentivize these two types of people to communicated back and forth and work together


Sales and Marketing
- Cold calling
- Inside Sales
- Building sales team
- BD - sales channel
How do crack this?
- Talk to Amir
- Find a Chief Revenue-like person who has tons of experience with this


Steven: How to prove/show that sub-businesses within overall business will work?  How do I validate this?
  - cash to start.  how much is needed to get self-sustaining?  where does it come from?
  - what is funder buying?  equity in parent?  equity in first/second product?  maybe talk to some lawyers who have done corporate structuring before, ideally with startup experience


Advisors
- Sales/marketing
- Legal (or HR?)
- BD / Corp Dev


Hooper: "Never do anything *just* because it's always been done that way."

Who else is doing this?
If no one, why not?

Ted talk about "fake it until you become it" (speaker from HBS)

- Ombitron: how to approach and create a positive interaction
