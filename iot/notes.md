What a simple hardware+software product can provide:
* Predictive maintenance:  predict when and how a device will fail and what replacement and maintenance parts and service personnel skills will be required to preempt the failure
* Loss prevention:  monitor device and network usage to flag unusual usage situations that may be indicators of revenue loss and theft
* Asset utilization:  monitor and predict asset utilization under a number of different usage scenarios in order to improve asset, device, and node utilization
* Inventory tracking:  monitor inventory levels and inventory assets to minimize loss and waste and improve inventory utilization
* Disaster planning and recovery:  model different disaster scenarios and likely device and network usage requirements to proactively plan for disaster situations (e.g., hurricanes, ice storms, tornados, earthquakes, Zodiac Killers)
* Downtime minimization:  leverage predictive maintenance and inventory tracking to identify high-probability downtime situations and ensure that the right maintenance and replacement parts are available, as well as the right skilled service personnel
* Energy usage optimization:  optimize energy usage given current and historical device performance, historical and predicted energy costs, and device performance requirements
* Device performance effectiveness:  monitor and optimize individual device performance/throughput based upon historical performance, given certain workloads and environmental conditions and coupled with a detailed profile of the performance behaviors of that device or node
* Capacity utilization:  reallocate device resources and jobs to optimize network and device performance given the history of device interactions and current and forecasted performance requirements
* Capacity planning:  predictive and prescriptive analytics that model product and device usage and in real time, make resource allocations and automate the provisioning of new capabilities (turning on and off capacity as dictated by the predictive models) in order to ensure the required capacity at the optimal price
* Demand forecasting:  leverage device behavioral models, actual usage patterns and trends, and external factors (weather, traffic, events) to forecast longer-term network configurations and product and network build out
* Pricing optimization:  understand device usage patterns, coupled with demand forecasting, to optimize device and network pricingâ€”lowering pricing when demand is low and increasing pricing when demand is higher; almost like surge pricing, but hopefully without the same customer satisfaction issues
* Yield management:  optimizing device and network usage to extract the most value out of the overall network capacity and capabilities
* Loading balancing optimization:  balancing usage load in light of forecasted demand to ensure that all nodes are being utilized equally and to avoid performance bottlenecks
