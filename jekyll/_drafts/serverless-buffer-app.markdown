I spend a large portion of my day reading.  Trying to make sense of my world, **the** world, the people in the world, and the ways in which we interact.  There are so many people, events, and discoveries that only 15 years ago were hidden in their own geographical locale unaccessible to me.  The internet and its news.google.com and Twitter and Hacker News and Medium and a multitude of other sites and applications have made the world's information so much more accessible, quickly accessible.

As I was reading more and more, I grew frustrated that I couldn't remember the important parts.  Remember back in school you used to underline and highlight and annotate the crap out of stuff?  I wanted to do that now!  Highlighting not only helped me better remember what I was reading, it helped me remember the **important** parts.

But how do you highlight in a web browser on a laptop?  And what about on a phone?  Or a Kindle?  Well, last year [Medium began allowing readers to save bits of text from blog posts by highlighting it.][medium-highlights]!  And the Kindle has allowed readers to highlight and save bits of text since its introduction.
