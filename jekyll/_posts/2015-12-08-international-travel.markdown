In the winter of 2014/15, I took off from the USA for four months to do some dirt biking in Africa, dog sledding in Sweden, and general exploring around the world!

I hadn't traveled much internationally prior to this.  I did a semester abroad in Ireland, but that didn't really seem like long-term, solo, international travel -- probably because the school program had everything so tightly organized for us.

This time, I organized everything myself stitching almost every activity on my bucket list into an epic 115 days of geographic, cultural, animal, and personal exploration.  I gotta say, the month-long planning process was almost as fun as the actual travel.  I started planning about a month of travel.  That grew to 1.5 months.  And then that ballooned to almost four months.  There was so much I wanted to do, and I knew I might not get an opportunity like this again.

#### "Are you going to drop off the face of the earth?"
My dad asked me this as I was planning out the itinerary.  He was worried he wouldn't hear from me for months and wouldn't know if I was having so much fun I just didn't have time to call or dead in a gutter somewhere.  Fair point.

I knew that I wasn't going to write.  I probably was going to forget to call.  But I knew for sure that I would be taking pictures.  So I setup a simple static web page with a [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) map on it and [pre-define some hashtags](https://github.com/crcastle/crcastle.github.io/blob/master/travel/markers.csv) for each location to which I was planning to travel.  Any time I posted a picture to Instagram all I had to do was tag it with one of the pre-defined hashtags and it would automatically appear on [the map web page][travel] associated with a pin showing where I was.  This was great because I wasn't going to have a computer with me while traveling.  I wouldn't have been able to manage anything more complex.

#### Free
All of this was and is completely free to run.  The HTML/CSS/JS files are stored on GitHub and served by GitHub Pages.  The customized map was free with a [Mapbox Starter Plan](https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/).

Here's [all the code][travel-files], including the JavaScript that ties it all together, if you're interested in digging in more.
