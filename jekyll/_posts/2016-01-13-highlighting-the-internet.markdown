I spend a large chunk of my day reading -- trying to make sense of my world, *the* world, the people in the world, and the ways in which we interact.  So many people, events, and discoveries just 15 years ago were hidden because the ease or expense of sharing that thing publicly was too large a hurdle.  The internet and its [news.google.com][news] and [Twitter][twitter] and [Hacker News][hackernews] and [Medium][medium] and a multitude of other sites and applications have made the world's information quickly and cheaply accessible.

As I was finding more and more to read, I grew frustrated by not being able to recall the important parts.  Remember back in school you used to underline and highlight and annotate the crap out of stuff you read for class?  I wanted that experience back.  Highlighting not only helps me better remember what I'm reading, it helps me distill and remember the important parts.

But how do you highlight in a web browser on a laptop?  And what about on a phone?  Or a Kindle?

Last year [Medium began allowing readers to save bits of text from blog posts by highlighting them][medium-highlights]!  And the Kindle has always allowed readers to highlight and save bits of text.  These two constitute a large part of my reading, but what about other websites.  I'll come back to this question in a future post.

Ok, now that we've got a solution to highlighting text on the internet, let's talk about how we might collect and organize those highlights.

Check back for Part 2, where I'll cover how I used [AWS Lambda][aws-lambda] to automatically extract my highlights and store them in a [Google Spreadsheet][highlights-spreadsheet] for posterity, manual review/lookup, statistical analysis, and even to power a section of this site!
